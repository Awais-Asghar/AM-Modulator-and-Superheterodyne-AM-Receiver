# AM-Modulator-and-Superheterodyne-AM-Receiver
This repository features the design and Proteus simulation of an AM transmitter and a Superheterodyne AM receiver for the medium-wave band. It includes MOSFET-based amplitude modulation, frequency down-conversion to 455â€¯kHz IF, and signal recovery via envelope detection using basic electronic components.
